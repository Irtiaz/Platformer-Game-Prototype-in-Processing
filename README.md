# Platformer-Game-Prototype-In-Processing
This is a platformer game (prototype) made in processing 3

This has platforms, coins and a camera which follows the player. In the ```platform.pde``` file there is a boolean called ```editing``` which can be toggled to move back and forth between the "Game view" and "Game edit view".

This generates ```map.txt``` file which holds all the information of the world. This file is auto-loaded every time the game is run in either view ("Game view" or "Game edit view").
