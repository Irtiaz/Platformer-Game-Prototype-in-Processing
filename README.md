# Platformer-Game-Prototype-In-Processing
This is a platformer game (prototype) made in Processing 3.
It has platforms, coins and a camera which follows the player.

By toggling the ```editing``` boolean the game can be converted to a visual game editor where platforms and coins can be added or removed. 

This generates a ```map.txt``` file which holds all the information of the platforms and coins which is auto-loaded everytime the game is run in "Game view" or "Game edit view"
